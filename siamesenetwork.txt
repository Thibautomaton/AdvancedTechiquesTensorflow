Siamese network

Create 2 base model with 2 separate inputs. It is suppose to compare similar pictures, used in handwritting recognition, face recognition. 
We are observing on mnist dataset. 
The model is composed of 3 dense layers

base_network = initialize_base_network()

input_a = Input(shape=(28, 28, ))

input_b = Input(shape=(28, 28, ))

vec_output_a = base_network(input_a)
vec_output_b = base_network(input_b)

output = euclidian_distnace -> Lambda( output_a/output_b

model = Model([input_a, input_b], ouput)
